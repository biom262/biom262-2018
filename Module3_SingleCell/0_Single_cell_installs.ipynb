However, it is a very useful tool to get an easy first-pass look at your data. Especially if you have sequenced with 10X, it can very easily read the output from the CellRanger pipeline. To install and use Seurat in a R notebook through jupyter, follow the comands below. We will be using this on Thursday, so please find time to perform these installations before class.\n",

    "Move to 'Connection->SSH->Tunnels'. Source port is: ####, Destination is: localhost:####. Then add the tunnel (these are the same steps used when you first created a jupyter notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Open jupyter in a web browser. Copy and paste the login token from tscc into a web browser and open jupyter. Check out if your seurat kernel is present by opening a new notebook and choosing the seurat kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) Shutting down the session. After 4 hours (or the length specified on your interactive job), everything will automatically shut down. To close before the 4 hours is over, type exit on the login node where you loaded the notebooks. This will exit the interactive job and take you back to the login node."
